This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). To write the code for the frontend, ChatGPT (GPT 3.5 turbo) was used. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you've already completed the steps to set up your Next.js development environment, including: 
- [Node.js 18.17](https://nodejs.org/) or later
- macOS, Windows (including WSL), or Linux
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation)

### Running the app

First, clone repository and run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Prompts

You can see the prompts that were used in [the coding.prompts file](https://github.com/malinoviylitiy/DDI_2023_private/edit/main/chatLLM/prompts/coding.prompts) in the chatLLM/prompts folder.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
